at each pressure, equilibrate ice and liquid separately at expected melting temperature. 
Only allow volume to adjust in x-direction, so that the two blocks can be easily "glued" together
Use ~4096 water and ~4096 liquid, for a total of ~8192 atoms ?
Run for 15 ns


Run 3 lammps scripts at each temperature:
1 - equilibrate ice
2 - equilibrate water
3 - glue together
4 - run for 15 ns

for the volume x,y dimensions, set to:
8*lattice constant
8*6.36339 = 50.9071 A
